Python Ethereum Blockchain Explorer
===================================

This simple project provides a Python json rpc api wrapper for a running geth node
as well as daemon continuously scanning incoming blocks and writing them in a mysql db for
convenient access.

Access is done via Storm, so PostgresSQL is also an option.
